# Alert System Implementation Summary

## Task: 37.13 - Implement notification and alert system

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Alert Manager Service (`services/ai/alert-manager.ts`)

A comprehensive alert management system with the following capabilities:

#### Alert Creation & Management
- `createAlert()` - Create new alerts with full configuration
- `acknowledgeAlert()` - Mark alerts as acknowledged
- `resolveAlert()` - Resolve alerts with resolution notes
- `snoozeAlert()` - Temporarily hide alerts with auto-reactivation
- `getActiveAlerts()` - Retrieve active alerts with filtering
- `getAlertHistory()` - Get historical alerts with pagination

#### Alert Rule Engine
- `createAlertRule()` - Define automatic alert triggers
- `updateAlertRule()` - Modify existing rules
- `deleteAlertRule()` - Remove alert rules
- `getAlertRules()` - List all configured rules
- `evaluateAlertRules()` - Evaluate rules against current context

#### Notification Routing
- Multi-channel support: in-app, email, SMS, webhook
- Intelligent channel selection based on severity
- Integration with existing notification store
- Placeholder implementations for external services

#### Alert Aggregation
- Configurable aggregation windows (default: 5 minutes)
- Maximum alerts per window (default: 3)
- Prevents notification fatigue during incidents
- Automatic grouping of similar alerts

#### Analytics & Reporting
- `getAlertAnalytics()` - Comprehensive alert statistics
- `getAlertAggregations()` - Grouped alert analysis
- MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) calculation
- Alerts by type, severity, and model
- Resolution trends over time

#### Helper Functions
- `alertModelFailure()` - Quick model failure alerts
- `alertHighErrorRate()` - Error rate threshold alerts
- `alertBudgetExceeded()` - Budget limit alerts
- `alertSecurityIncident()` - Security event alerts
- `alertPerformanceDegradation()` - Performance alerts
- `alertRateLimitWarning()` - Rate limit warnings
- `alertAnomalyDetected()` - Anomaly detection alerts

### 2. Alert Management UI (`app/ai-control-center/alerts/page.tsx`)

A comprehensive dashboard for managing alerts:

#### Features
- **Active Alerts Tab**: View and manage current alerts
- **History Tab**: Browse historical alerts
- **Analytics Tab**: View alert statistics and trends
- **Quick Stats Cards**: Key metrics at a glance
  - Active alerts count
  - Resolved alerts today
  - Average resolution time
  - MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)

#### Alert Actions
- Acknowledge alerts
- Resolve alerts with notes
- Snooze alerts (30 minutes default)
- View alert details
- Filter by severity, type, and model

#### Visual Design
- Color-coded severity indicators
- Status badges (active, acknowledged, resolved, snoozed)
- Relative timestamps ("2 hours ago")
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

### 3. Alert Rule Builder Component (`components/ai-control/AlertRuleBuilder.tsx`)

A visual interface for creating alert rules:

#### Condition Builder
- **Threshold conditions**: Numeric comparisons (>, <, >=, <=, =)
- **Pattern matching**: Regular expressions
- **Anomaly detection**: ML-based patterns
- **Custom expressions**: JavaScript evaluation

#### Configuration Options
- Rule name and description
- Alert type selection (8 predefined types)
- Severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
- Message template with variable interpolation
- Notification channel selection
- Aggregation settings
- Escalation configuration

#### User Experience
- Intuitive form-based interface
- Dynamic condition builder
- Real-time validation
- Save/cancel actions

### 4. Alert Rule List Component (`components/ai-control/AlertRuleList.tsx`)

A management interface for existing alert rules:

#### Features
- List all configured rules
- Toggle rules active/inactive
- View rule statistics (trigger count, last triggered)
- Edit existing rules
- Delete rules with confirmation
- Visual indicators for rule status

#### Display Information
- Rule name and description
- Alert type and severity
- Condition type
- Notification channels
- Aggregation settings
- Trigger statistics

### 5. Documentation

#### Alert System README (`services/ai/ALERT_SYSTEM_README.md`)
Comprehensive documentation including:
- System overview and architecture
- Feature descriptions
- Usage examples
- API reference
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide
- Integration details

#### Implementation Summary (this document)
Quick reference for what was implemented and how to use it.

## Database Schema

The system uses existing database tables:

### `aiAlerts` Table
- Alert details (type, severity, title, message)
- Status tracking (active, acknowledged, resolved, snoozed)
- Notification tracking (channels, sent count)
- Escalation information
- Timestamps and user attribution

### `aiAlertRules` Table
- Rule configuration (name, description, condition)
- Alert settings (type, severity, message template)
- Notification preferences
- Aggregation settings
- Escalation configuration
- Trigger statistics

## Integration Points

### 1. AI Activity Logger
All alert actions are logged for audit purposes:
- Alert creation
- Alert acknowledgment
- Alert resolution
- Alert snoozing

### 2. Notification Store (Zustand)
In-app notifications are managed through the existing notification store:
- Priority-based queuing
- Auto-dismiss timers
- Action button support
- Multiple notification types

### 3. Security Audit Logger
Critical alerts trigger security audit entries for compliance.

## Key Features Implemented

✅ Real-time alert generation for critical AI events
✅ Configurable alert channels (in-app, email, SMS, webhook)
✅ Alert rule configuration UI with condition builder
✅ Alert aggregation to prevent notification fatigue
✅ Alert history viewer with acknowledgment tracking
✅ Alert snoozing functionality with automatic re-enabling
✅ Alert analytics dashboard showing trends and resolution times
✅ Helper functions for common alert scenarios
✅ Integration with existing notification system
✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { AlertManager, alertHelpers } from '@/services/ai/alert-manager';

// Initialize on app startup
await AlertManager.initialize();

// Create alerts using helpers
await alertHelpers.highErrorRate('doc-classifier-v2', 0.35, 0.20);

// Create custom alert
await AlertManager.createAlert({
  alertType: 'performance-degradation',
  severity: 'high',
  title: 'Slow Response Time',
  message: 'Model response time exceeded threshold',
  modelName: 'medical-nlp',
  notificationChannels: ['in-app', 'email'],
});

// Create alert rule
await AlertManager.createAlertRule({
  ruleName: 'High Error Rate Alert',
  conditionType: 'threshold',
  condition: {
    type: 'threshold',
    field: 'errorRate',
    operator: 'gt',
    value: 0.20,
  },
  alertType: 'high-error-rate',
  severity: 'high',
  messageTemplate: 'Error rate is {{errorRate}}% for {{modelName}}',
  notificationChannels: ['in-app', 'email'],
  aggregationWindow: 5,
  maxAlertsPerWindow: 3,
});

// Evaluate rules
await AlertManager.evaluateAlertRules({
  modelName: 'doc-classifier-v2',
  errorRate: 0.25,
  responseTime: 1500,
});

// Get analytics
const analytics = await AlertManager.getAlertAnalytics();
console.log('MTTR:', analytics.mttr, 'minutes');
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Test alert creation, rule evaluation, and condition matching
2. **Integration Tests**: Test notification routing and database operations
3. **UI Tests**: Test alert dashboard and rule builder interactions
4. **Performance Tests**: Test alert aggregation under high load
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete alert lifecycle from creation to resolution

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Alert correlation and root cause analysis
- Custom notification templates
- Alert scheduling (quiet hours)
- Mobile push notifications
- Slack/Teams integration
- Alert playbooks and runbooks
- SLA tracking and reporting
