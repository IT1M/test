- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ No diagnostic errors
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Accessibility considerations
- ✅ Clean code structure
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Performance Optimizations

1. **useCallback** for memoized functions
2. **ResponsiveContainer** for efficient chart rendering
3. **Conditional rendering** to avoid unnecessary updates
4. **Efficient state management** with minimal re-renders
5. **Lazy loading** potential for charts

### User Experience

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear tab structure
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states and animations
- **Informative**: Detailed tooltips and descriptions
- **Actionable**: Direct links to implement optimizations
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Integration Points

- **API Endpoint**: `/api/ai-control/cost-analytics`
- **Auth Store**: `useAuthStore` for user permissions
- **Router**: Next.js router for navigation
- **Permission Check**: `ACCESS_AI_CONTROL_CENTER` required

### Mock Data

Currently using mock data for:
- Optimization recommendations
- Cache metrics
- Budget alerts
- ROI metrics
- Model efficiency scores

**Note**: In production, these would be fetched from actual API endpoints.

### Future Enhancements
