# OEE Tracking and Analytics Implementation Summary

## Task 38.3 - Completed

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) tracking and analytics system for manufacturing operations. The system provides real-time monitoring, historical analysis, and AI-powered insights to improve manufacturing efficiency.

### Components Implemented

#### 1. Manufacturing Analytics Service (`services/analytics/manufacturing.ts`)
A complete analytics engine for OEE calculation and analysis:

**Core Functionality:**
- **OEE Calculation**: Implements the standard formula: OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality
  - **Availability**: (Actual Run Time / Planned Production Time) × 100
  - **Performance**: (Ideal Cycle Time × Total Units / Actual Run Time) × 100
  - **Quality**: (Good Units / Total Units) × 100

**Key Methods:**
- `calculateOEE(machineId, startDate, endDate)`: Calculate OEE for a specific machine and time period
- `getOEEByMachine(startDate, endDate)`: Get OEE breakdown across all machines
- `getOEEByProduct(startDate, endDate)`: Get OEE breakdown by product type
- `getOEETrend(machineId, startDate, endDate, interval)`: Get historical OEE trends
- `getOEEAlerts(threshold, startDate, endDate)`: Get alerts for machines below threshold
- `storeMachineMetrics(machineId, startDate, endDate)`: Persist metrics to database
- `getHistoricalMetrics(machineId, startDate, endDate)`: Retrieve historical data

**Data Integration:**
- Production Runs: Actual vs target quantities, good vs rejected units
- Machine Downtime: Planned and unplanned downtime events
- Machine Specifications: Target speed, capacity, cycle time
- Machine Metrics: Historical performance data

#### 2. OEE Monitoring Dashboard (`app/manufacturing/oee/page.tsx`)
A comprehensive real-time monitoring interface:

**Features:**
- **Filters**:
  - Machine selection (individual or all machines)
  - Time range selection (today, last 7 days, last 30 days)
  
- **Key Metrics Cards**:
  - Overall OEE with status badge (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement)
  - Availability with downtime minutes
  - Performance with output units
  - Quality with rejected units count
  - Color-coded indicators based on performance vs target

- **OEE Trend Chart**:
  - Area chart showing OEE over time
  - Multiple lines for Availability, Performance, and Quality
  - Target reference line (default 85%)
  - Configurable intervals (hourly for today, daily for longer periods)
  - Interactive tooltips with detailed metrics

- **Tabbed Breakdown Views**:
  1. **By Machine**: Bar chart comparing all machines
  2. **By Product**: Bar chart showing product-level OEE
  3. **Alerts**: List of underperforming machines with severity levels
  4. **AI Insights**: Gemini AI-powered analysis and recommendations

- **Alert System**:
  - Automatic detection of machines below threshold
  - Severity classification (warning: 68-85%, critical: <68%)
  - Detailed breakdown of OEE components
  - Timestamp and machine identification

- **AI-Powered Insights**:
  - Pattern analysis across all machines
  - Specific recommendations for improvement
  - Priority actions for underperforming machines
  - Best practices from top performers
  - Generated on-demand using Gemini AI

- **Auto-Refresh**: Data refreshes every 5 minutes
- **Export**: Functionality to export reports (UI ready)

#### 3. Manufacturing Index Page (`app/manufacturing/page.tsx`)
Navigation hub for all manufacturing modules:

**Features:**
- Quick stats dashboard (placeholder for real-time data)
- Module cards with descriptions and navigation
- Implementation status indicators
- System overview with feature lists

### Technical Implementation

#### OEE Calculation Logic
```typescript
// Planned Production Time = Total Time - Planned Downtime
const plannedProductionTime = totalTime - plannedDowntime;

// Actual Run Time = Planned Production Time - Unplanned Downtime
const actualRunTime = plannedProductionTime - unplannedDowntime;

// Availability = (Actual Run Time / Planned Production Time) × 100
const availability = (actualRunTime / plannedProductionTime) * 100;

// Ideal Cycle Time = 60 minutes / Target Speed (units per hour)
const idealCycleTime = 60 / machine.targetSpeed;

// Performance = (Ideal Cycle Time × Total Units / Actual Run Time) × 100
const performance = (idealCycleTime * totalUnits / actualRunTime) * 100;

// Quality = (Good Units / Total Units) × 100
const quality = (goodUnits / totalUnits) * 100;

// OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality / 10000
const oee = (availability * performance * quality) / 10000;
```

#### Data Flow
1. User selects machine and time range
2. Service queries production runs, downtime, and machine data
3. OEE components calculated based on actual vs planned metrics
4. Results displayed in cards, charts, and breakdowns
5. Alerts generated for machines below threshold
6. AI insights generated on demand

#### Performance Optimizations
- Caching of calculation results
- Efficient database queries with indexes
- Batch processing for multiple machines
- Lazy loading of AI insights
- Auto-refresh with configurable intervals

### Integration Points

**Database Tables Used:**
- `machines`: Machine specifications and capacity
- `productionRuns`: Production execution data
- `machineDowntime`: Downtime events and categories
- `machineMetrics`: Historical performance metrics
- `products`: Product information for breakdown

**External Services:**
- Gemini AI: Pattern analysis and recommendations
- Recharts: Data visualization
- shadcn/ui: UI components

### Key Metrics and Thresholds

**OEE Target**: 85% (industry standard for world-class manufacturing)

**Status Levels:**
- **Excellent**: ≥85% (green)
- **Good**: 68-84% (yellow)
- **Needs Improvement**: <68% (red)

**Alert Severity:**
- **Warning**: OEE between 68% and 85%
- **Critical**: OEE below 68%

### Benefits

1. **Real-Time Visibility**: Instant view of manufacturing performance
2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Objective metrics for improvement
3. **Proactive Management**: Alerts for underperforming machines
4. **Trend Analysis**: Historical patterns and performance tracking
5. **AI Insights**: Intelligent recommendations for optimization
6. **Benchmarking**: Compare machines and products
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Identify best practices and replicate

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Shift-based OEE analysis

3. Record downtime events (planned and unplanned)
4. Verify OEE calculations match expected values
5. Test alert generation at different thresholds
6. Validate trend charts with historical data
7. Generate AI insights and verify relevance

### Documentation
